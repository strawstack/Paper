# A Few Things

- 4-day work week (actually 3.5 day overtime if one wants to work five).
- basic income (we have a right to defend the country, we get paid to defend the country, the country fails if anyone isn't getting basic income).
- universal health care.
- public housing (pay people to build it, give people a place to life, so they can give back).
- free university (life long learning, just make sure everyone has the tools to advance their learning).
- trains over cars (don't pay for road repair to make cities less dense, let people concentrate on activities instead of driving).
- the right to creative labour (don't take away humans ability to practice their craft, it's not about the product it's about maintaining and improving the skill over time, and exploring the human realm of possibility through art).
- fluid citizenship (people can change countries just as they can change cities inside a country).
- rank choice voting (because we shouldn't have to forfeit our opinion on lower candidates to vote for the top one).
- proportional representation (our voice shouldn't be silenced just because it isn't the majority).
- anti-trust law.
- Systemic equality is equality as the outcome of the system rather than the intent of th system.
- Taxation and regulation to group human wealth and quality of life into something of a normal distribution.
