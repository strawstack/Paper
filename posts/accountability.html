# Accountability

some people are poor and get jailed
some people are rich and do harm
there physical violence and there's oppressive violence
there are direct crimes and there are crimes with multiple steps

Everyone should have the same rules by which they are accountable, but there seem to be links that authority refuses to follow when making determniations about an individuals resposibility and these links are too often ones that if followed would lead us to hold the authority itself accountable
