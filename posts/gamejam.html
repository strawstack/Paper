# Game Jams

game jams for charity and themed around positive community.
Extra life 24-hour, and some people make games along site.
People donate, participate, and watch the streams.
I could make a site that advertized charity jams related to extra life.
I could join jams that aer related to charity or themed around positive values, or educational ideas.
I could host jams around these ideas.

The idea is to create content that has a positive impact.
