summary: the more options we have the less certian we are about which is best

# Certianty

A reflection about how I play the opening of Astronner repeatedly and how when the game gets more complex. There is a point of diminishing return. There are several branching task presented, the player can do any number of them. Each task seems smaller in value because of the growing number, and the rewards are smaller compaired to the first few items the player is awarded because those make a big impact in terms of the speed at which the player advances.

In the beginning, there is a list of tasks, and it's very clear what the player has to do. 

There's also a situation that I think many are familliar with where if someone has one option available they occupy their time with that one thing, but if there are many options then a person will not be able to decide what they want to do and they will end up doing nothing. 

In university, I was able to take the vast number of options that I had an convince myself more easily that the essay assigned to me was the task that I wanted to work on. This was kind of like down playing the other options and rasing the value of one option until I became very certian about what I wanted to do. Of course, this was helped by the fact that I needed to eventually graduate. There was external value do doing the essay. Just as there was external value to participating in the MinnMax game jam. There are moments where one task has raised value, so it's easier to concentrate. 

There are times when it is very unclear what move will yield the best reward, so there's just no way to make the decision other than randomly, and randomly doesn't leave one feeling very motivated to do the chosen task.
