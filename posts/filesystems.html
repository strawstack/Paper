title: Filesystems we have and the filesystems we use

summary: the filesystems we have, and the filesystems we use

# Filesystems

We use dirs and files, and we interact with file explorer, or via programs. Sometimes OS like linux rely on files as part of their infrascructure.
Instead we should have data storage for programs, accessible DBs, videos should be like images when interacted with.
Filesystems are overloaded with functionality and break down easily. We could advance and seperate them.

The general form of this article is about persisting different kinds of data and making them accessible to programs and people and this is something fundmental that should include the value assessment talked about by Gracehopper.
