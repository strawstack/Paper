# Open Apps

I've been sitting down at my computer lately with the idea that I want to create something, and I end up getting up some time later having created nothing. I've created a variaty of things in the past: writtings, videos, art, music, video games, applicaitons, and websites. In the past, I've found places to write; tools to make videos; I've downloaded indie raster editors; used online vector design tools; created music with free and paid tier websites; built games with engines; and designed websites and apps using open source code editors and Javascript frameworks. 

There have been times when I've found the right tool at the right time to create what I want to create. 

I sat down at my computer today, and I wanted to write about the lack of tools available for creation, and I realized I didn't have a place to write. I've written privatly in a moleskin notebook before, and that's been rewarding but moleskin notebook are really expensive now. I've used nice pens from Muji, but Muji closed West coast stores during the pandemic, so I use a pen from work now, and it doesn't write as smoothly, so it's not as fun.

I've created blogs before. Hosted blogs don't offer me enough flexibility; paid solutions don't let me feel free when I'm writting; paid solutions don't feel like they'll last into the future (where my writting might get read) for very long after I stop paying. 

Free blog frameworks require some amount of set up. They require one to remember how to work the content management system. They do extra things that one has to learn how to turn off, or else they become distracting. If one leaves them for awhile, one forgets how they work, and there's a time and eenrgy cost to starting them up again.

I've written on Google docs, but Google, like all big tech companies is in decline, and I don't like storing information in a place that's in decline. It's always good to have a migration plan, but I don't know where else to go. I though for a moment I'd try Obsidian, but to publish one has to pay, and you have to download an OS locked app to write, and there's no browser version.

I made videos for awhile with iMovie, but I moved off Mac to Windows when I wanted a gaming PC. I tried installing Linux on my gaming PC, but bluetooth headphones never worked, and, one day, Steam and DaVinci Resolve just wouldn't open anymore. I read something about a bad window update in forms, and decided to recultantly go back to Windows. I downloaded Resolve on Windows and sometimes when I make videos longer than ten minutes in duration Windows glitchs and can't find the video files I'm editing, and I have to restart my computer a few times. It doesn't feel like I'm creating something pure and correct and stable if I have to restart my computer a few times.

I want a place to make games. I used to use Unity but it didn't use pixel coordinates, so there were always gaps between sprites. Constant updates to the engine would leave projects with broken references. The Unity app iself is Gbs in size, takes a long time to download, and takes a long time to build and export a game. When exporting to the web, one needs a Plugin for the browser, and to show the Unity logo which interferes with design and player experience. Godot is fairly ideal in conpairison, but the WASM build for a Godot project is 60Mb minimum which is a lot for a player to download to play a simple game. ThreeJS is a good size (only a few Mbs) but it doesn't come with a graphical editor or collision detection.  

Music can be made with expensive instruments or hardware, or subscription services where you essentially have a time limit to create something of value or else you're just spending money to stare at a bunch of UI that someone else uses somewhere to make something I'm sure. I found a tool called Soundtrap which is decent and has a decent free tier, but I'm just bothered by what I would say is the intrinsic beat that each sample track has, and how this beat automatically tries to adjust to fit ones timeline which makes music creation feel more like using lego blocks made of playdough to build a skyscraper. Eventually it ends up sounding like how that would end up looking.  

I want to write my own applications, but I don't want to choose a platform or a language. I want to write in whatever language I want and have my applications run on any computer. Every computer has a browser, so I like to use Javascript (WebAssembly is not ready yet, and will never be, but should by now let any language interface seamlessly in a web environment). So, I write apps in Javascript in a browser, and the apps only work in the browser that I write them in, and only for the same OS that the browser is running on, and the performance of the apps is only good on my computer with my internet connection. Since, I'm writting for the web I can't save or load files, or start a server, or create and communicate between multiple windows.   

So I usually give up on creating anything and try to watch TV or movies for inspiration. I want a place to watch TV that doesn't dissipear shows that I like, or introduce ads, or raise the price, or slowly release episodes hoping to push me to renew for another month.

I can create if I stand in exactly the right place at the right time. Or jump through the right hoops, and think the right way, and ignore the rough edges, and take out my wallet, but sometimes what I want to create cannot be created with those constraints. Sometimes what I want to create is a better way forward and a better way forward can't be created from the only place where I currently stand. So, I need to create a new place to stand, and to do that I have to balance in a certian position using the few stable holds around me, and I need to hold that position until things shift just enough that I can put one foot on solid ground and then the other, and eventually walk in a direction of my choosing for an unspecified amount of time.
