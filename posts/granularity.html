title: Data Granularity
date: 24 Jan 2025
summary: what isn't measured isn't known
+++
# Data Granularity

collection of granular data excludes the data not collected
we maintain a model of the world with certian metrics
we optimize for these metrics at the "expense" of what isn't measured
the world is messy and the mess is part of the human part of the world
trying to clean the world removes the very important messy part of human flourishing
