# Open Apps

I woke up one day and I realized I didn't have any of the tools I needed to do the things that I want.

I want a place to write that isn't an expensive private notebook, or a big tech owned web app, or a downloadable application fixed to one OS. 

I want a place to make videos and art that isn't an Adobe product, or a heavy weight application that sometimes just stops working or fails to find the clips stored as local files on my system.

I want a place to make games that isn't Unity because of the bloat or Godot because of the WASM export size when exporting for web.

I want a place to make music that isn't a 4k instrument, or Ableton, or owned by Spotify.

I want a way to write my own applications that isn't degraded by the limited capabilities of the web, or specific to one platform.

I want a place to watch TV that doesn't dissipear shows that I like, or introduce ads, or raise the price, or slowly release episodes hoping to push me to renew for another month.

I can do all these things if I stand in exactly the right place at the right time. Or jump through the right hoops, and think the right way, and ignore the rough edges, and take out my wallet, but sometimes what I want to create is not creatable with those constraints. Sometimes what I want to create is a better way forward and a better way forward can be created from the only place where I can currently stand.
