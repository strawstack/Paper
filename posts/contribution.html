# Contribution

There are many ways and mediums by which we contribute to discourse.
In our actions, we like to contribute or we like to rest. 
In our rest, we often think of the next time we will contribute.
The most direct contribution is to talk to one other person.
Then a group of people.
Then produce some kind of content to a small audience (that gives feedback in some way).
Then a large audience.
We lose control of our contributions.
What relationship do we ultimatly have to our contributions.
